# ChatApp
A simple chat application that features a Flask back-end with database storage on SqLite3, React on front-end side and Socket.io for communication.


## Easy Start:
1. Verify that you have NPM, Python3, and Pip installed.
2. Execute the `run.sh` script:
```bash
$ ./run.sh # from the root of the project
```
This will install all dependencies and startup the Flask server.
Once the server is running, visit `http://localhost:5000` in your
browser to view the application. The React front-end will be served
from `client/build`. If you want to work on the source code, see the
'Development' instructions below.


## Development
### Setup

**1. Install client-side dependencies:**
```bash
$ cd client # from the root of the project
$ npm install
```

**2. Install server-side dependencies:**
```bash
$ cd server # from the root of the project
$ pip install --editable .
```

### Editing

**1. Start the Flask server:** _(In another terminal window/tab:)_
```bash
$ cd server
$ export FLASK_DEBUG=True
$ export FLASK_APP=server
$ flask run
```
This will start up a Flask server at `http://localhost:5000`.

**2. Start the React development server:**
```bash
$ cd client
$ yarn start
```
This will startup a React development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

**3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.**

**4. Edit away! The app will automatically reload as you make changes.**
